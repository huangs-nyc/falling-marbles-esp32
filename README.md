# About
This is the code respository for a falling marbles display, created for Creative Embedded Systems, and written in C++.

# Instructions
Take the code in falling_marbles.ino and put it into the Arduino IDE. After connecting your ESP32 LILYGO board to your computer, upload the code/sketch to the board.
After the code is uploaded successfully, the display should have round balls of different colors scattering, slowing down/going off screen, and then a white circle 
filling the screen. After it fully covers the screen, the display loops.


Ensure that there is a power source for the ESP32 display: battery, computer, etc.

# Demonstration
Once the code is uploaded, the display should look like this:

This display was added to a decorated envelope with an attached battery, then put on display:
