# About
This is the code respository for a falling marbles display, created for Creative Embedded Systems, and written in C++.

Link to blog post with in-depth development process: https://star-truffle-b24.notion.site/Welcome-to-Steven-s-C-E-S-Blog-1124dc2df41c8034a42bfcaa1fb9474e

# Instructions
Take the code in falling_marbles.ino and put it into the Arduino IDE. After connecting your ESP32 LILYGO board to your computer, upload the code/sketch to the board.
After the code is uploaded successfully, the display should have round balls of different colors scattering, slowing down/going off screen, and then a white circle 
filling the screen. After it fully covers the screen, the display loops.

It should look like this:

Ensure that there is a power source for the ESP32 display: battery, computer, etc.

# Display Installation
1) Once the display is functional and looks like the above, you can attach a battery to the side of the board opposite of the display screen.

2) Prepare a cardstock envelope big enough to fit the battery and board with a hole for the display and smaller holdes for string, and decorate the way that you want.

3) Tape the board and battery to the envelope, fold it up, and tape it closed.

4) Tie the string onto the envelope so that it hangs from the screen.
